## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

It's a documentation page about Blender, a software for 3D modeling.

It constitutes the exercise to obtain the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design certification.

Pull requests are welcome, feel free to collaborate. Was made with HTML and CSS.

## Take a look!
